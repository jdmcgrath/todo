# Todo
This bookfinder is my second Angular project. It uses basic JavaScript logic to handle the Create and Delete functions for the Todo list.
Using TypeScript to set the expected output of a function was helpful in handling the response appropriately, and will make the project more understandable for other developers.
Using Angular's emit function was new to me, but felt similar to React's functions as props.

### Tech

This site uses the following languages & principles:

  - Angular
  - TypeScript

  - SCSS / CSS

And of course my todo list itself is open source, so feel free to pick and choose bits you like to host on your own GitHub!

### Todos

 - Add accounts to store people's todos over multiple sessions
